Given an array  intervals  where  intervals[i] = [l i , r i ]  represent the interval  [l i , r i ) , remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list. The interval  [a, b)  is covered by the interval  [c, d)  if and only if  c <= a  and  b <= d . Return  the number of remaining intervals .   Example 1: Input:  intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]
 Output:  2
 Explanation:  Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed.
 Example 2: Input:  intervals = [[1,4],[2,3]]
 Output:  1
   Constraints: 1 <= intervals.length <= 1000 intervals[i].length == 2 0 <= l i  < r i  <= 10 5 All the given intervals are  unique .

class Solution:
    def removeCoveredIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
