A city's  skyline  is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return  the  skyline  formed by these buildings collectively . The geometric information of each building is given in the array  buildings  where  buildings[i] = [left i , right i , height i ] : left i  is the x coordinate of the left edge of the  i th  building. right i  is the x coordinate of the right edge of the  i th  building. height i  is the height of the  i th  building. You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height  0 . The  skyline  should be represented as a list of "key points"  sorted by their x-coordinate  in the form  [[x 1 ,y 1 ],[x 2 ,y 2 ],...] . Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate  0  and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour. Note:  There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance,  [...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]  is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such:  [...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]   Example 1: Input:  buildings = [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]
 Output:  [[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]
 Explanation: 
Figure A shows the buildings of the input.
Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list.
 Example 2: Input:  buildings = [[0,2,3],[2,5,3]]
 Output:  [[0,3],[5,0]]
   Constraints: 1 <= buildings.length <= 10 4 0 <= left i  < right i  <= 2 31  - 1 1 <= height i  <= 2 31  - 1 buildings  is sorted by  left i  in non-decreasing order.
