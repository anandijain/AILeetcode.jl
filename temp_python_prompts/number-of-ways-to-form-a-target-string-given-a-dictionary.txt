You are given a list of strings of the  same length words  and a string  target . Your task is to form  target  using the given  words  under the following rules: target  should be formed from left to right. To form the  i th  character ( 0-indexed ) of  target , you can choose the  k th  character of the  j th  string in  words  if  target[i] = words[j][k] . Once you use the  k th  character of the  j th  string of  words , you  can no longer  use the  x th  character of any string in  words  where  x <= k . In other words, all characters to the left of or at index  k  become unusuable for every string. Repeat the process until you form the string  target . Notice  that you can use  multiple characters  from the  same string  in  words  provided the conditions above are met. Return  the number of ways to form  target  from  words . Since the answer may be too large, return it  modulo 10 9  + 7 .   Example 1: Input:  words = ["acca","bbbb","caca"], target = "aba"
 Output:  6
 Explanation:  There are 6 ways to form target.
"aba" -> index 0 (" a cca"), index 1 ("b b bb"), index 3 ("cac a ")
"aba" -> index 0 (" a cca"), index 2 ("bb b b"), index 3 ("cac a ")
"aba" -> index 0 (" a cca"), index 1 ("b b bb"), index 3 ("acc a ")
"aba" -> index 0 (" a cca"), index 2 ("bb b b"), index 3 ("acc a ")
"aba" -> index 1 ("c a ca"), index 2 ("bb b b"), index 3 ("acc a ")
"aba" -> index 1 ("c a ca"), index 2 ("bb b b"), index 3 ("cac a ")
 Example 2: Input:  words = ["abba","baab"], target = "bab"
 Output:  4
 Explanation:  There are 4 ways to form target.
"bab" -> index 0 (" b aab"), index 1 ("b a ab"), index 2 ("ab b a")
"bab" -> index 0 (" b aab"), index 1 ("b a ab"), index 3 ("baa b ")
"bab" -> index 0 (" b aab"), index 2 ("ba a b"), index 3 ("baa b ")
"bab" -> index 1 ("a b ba"), index 2 ("ba a b"), index 3 ("baa b ")
   Constraints: 1 <= words.length <= 1000 1 <= words[i].length <= 1000 All strings in  words  have the same length. 1 <= target.length <= 1000 words[i]  and  target  contain only lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def numWays(self, words: List[str], target: str) -> int:
