A positive integer is  magical  if it is divisible by either  a  or  b . Given the three integers  n ,  a , and  b , return the  n th  magical number. Since the answer may be very large,  return it modulo  10 9  + 7 .   Example 1: Input:  n = 1, a = 2, b = 3
 Output:  2
 Example 2: Input:  n = 4, a = 2, b = 3
 Output:  6
   Constraints: 1 <= n <= 10 9 2 <= a, b <= 4 * 10 4
