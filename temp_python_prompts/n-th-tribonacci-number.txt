The Tribonacci sequence T n  is defined as follows:  T 0  = 0, T 1  = 1, T 2  = 1, and T n+3  = T n  + T n+1  + T n+2  for n >= 0. Given  n , return the value of T n .   Example 1: Input:  n = 4
 Output:  4
 Explanation: 
T_3 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
T_4 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
 Example 2: Input:  n = 25
 Output:  1389537
   Constraints: 0 <= n <= 37 The answer is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit integer, ie.  answer <= 2^31 - 1 .

class Solution:
