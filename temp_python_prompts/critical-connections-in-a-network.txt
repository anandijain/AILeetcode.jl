There are  n  servers numbered from  0  to  n - 1  connected by undirected server-to-server  connections  forming a network where  connections[i] = [a i , b i ]  represents a connection between servers  a i  and  b i . Any server can reach other servers directly or indirectly through the network. A  critical connection  is a connection that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach some other server. Return all critical connections in the network in any order.   Example 1: Input:  n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
 Output:  [[1,3]]
 Explanation:  [[3,1]] is also accepted.
 Example 2: Input:  n = 2, connections = [[0,1]]
 Output:  [[0,1]]
   Constraints: 2 <= n <= 10 5 n - 1 <= connections.length <= 10 5 0 <= a i , b i  <= n - 1 a i  != b i There are no repeated connections.

class Solution:
    def criticalConnections(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
