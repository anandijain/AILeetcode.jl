{"data":{"question":{"content":"<p>You are given a <strong>perfect binary tree</strong> where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children.

The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with &#39;#&#39; signifying the end of each level.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> root = []\n<strong>Output:</strong> []\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[0, 2<sup>12</sup> - 1]</code>.</li>\n\t<li><code>-1000 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 1000</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Follow-up:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>You may only use constant extra space.</li>\n\t<li>The recursive approach is fine.
