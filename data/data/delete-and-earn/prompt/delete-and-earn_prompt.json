{"data":{"question":{"content":"<p>You are given an integer array <code>nums</code>. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Pick any <code>nums[i]</code> and delete it to earn <code>nums[i]</code> points. Afterwards, you must delete <b>every</b> element equal to <code>nums[i] - 1</code> and <strong>every</strong> element equal to <code>nums[i] + 1</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum number of points</strong> you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [3,4,2]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 6\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> You can perform the following operations:\n- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].\n- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].\nYou earn a total of 6 points.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 9\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> You can perform the following operations:\n- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2&#39;s and 4&#39;s are also deleted. nums = [3,3].\n- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].\n- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].\nYou earn a total of 9 points.</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>\n</ul>\n","mysqlSchemas":[]}}}
