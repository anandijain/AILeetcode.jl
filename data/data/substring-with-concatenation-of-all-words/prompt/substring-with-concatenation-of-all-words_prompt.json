{"data":{"question":{"content":"<p>You are given a string <code>s</code> and an array of strings <code>words</code>. All the strings of <code>words</code> are of <strong>the same length</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>A <strong>concatenated substring</strong> in <code>s</code> is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of <code>words</code> concatenated.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>For example, if <code>words = [&quot;ab&quot;,&quot;cd&quot;,&quot;ef&quot;]</code>, then <code>&quot;abcdef&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;abefcd&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;cdabef&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;cdefab&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;efabcd&quot;</code>, and <code>&quot;efcdab&quot;</code> are all concatenated strings. <code>&quot;acdbef&quot;</code> is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of <code>words</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return <em>the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in </em><code>s</code>. You can return the answer in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;barfoothefoobarman&quot;, words = [&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;]\n<strong>Output:</strong> [0,9]\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Since words.length == 2 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.\nThe substring starting at 0 is &quot;barfoo&quot;. It is the concatenation of [&quot;bar&quot;,&quot;foo&quot;] which is a permutation of words.\nThe substring starting at 9 is &quot;foobar&quot;. It is the concatenation of [&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;] which is a permutation of words.\nThe output order does not matter.
